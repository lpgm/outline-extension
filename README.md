## How to install the extension in Windows 

1. Create a new directory for the extension, for example, "C:\Users\<you>\projects\outline-extension". 

2. Copy all the files here into the new directory. 

3. Open a new browser tab and go to "chrome://extensions/". 

4. Turn on "Developer mode" in the upper right corner, click "Load unpacked" on the left hand side, and select the extension directory.
